## Algorithms Used 🚀

This project compares the performance of the following machine learning algorithms for stroke prediction:

1. **Logistic Regression 🧮**  
   A statistical method used for binary classification, ideal for understanding the relationship between input variables and the likelihood of stroke.

2. **Decision Tree 🌳**  
   A tree-structured model that splits data into branches based on decision rules, offering an intuitive and interpretable prediction method.

3. **Random Forest 🌲**  
   An ensemble learning method combining multiple decision trees to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.

4. **Support Vector Machine (SVM) 📏**  
   A powerful algorithm that uses hyperplanes to separate data points, effective for classification tasks with high-dimensional data.

5. **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) 🚀**  
   A robust ensemble technique that builds models sequentially to correct errors made by prior models, providing state-of-the-art performance.

Each algorithm was evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine their suitability for stroke prediction.
